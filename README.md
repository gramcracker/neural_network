# neural_network
This is my personal project to make a realatively simple neural network library in C++.
I created it specifically with natural language processing in mind, but works well for just about anything, although it is still a work in progress.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You will need c++11 support. This works best with g++11 and up. You may need to tell your compiler to use the thread library with the -lpthread option.

```
g++ -std=c++11 foo.cpp -lpthread -o foo
```
### Installing
Download the code and modify the makefile to fit your project.

### Usage
Examples on how to use this library can be found in the examples folder.
